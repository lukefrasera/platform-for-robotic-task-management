\begin{abstract}
Task planning in robotics is a difficult problem. The problem of task planning is known to be NP-hard. It is important for robots to be able to plan quickly in order for interaction with people to be fluid. These fast decisions enable the robot to work with people efficiently. A robot also needs to be able to understand the work done by others so that a collaborative work environment can be achieved. This report proposes a robot task architecture to achieve such collaborative behaviour with both multi-people and multi-robot tasks.
